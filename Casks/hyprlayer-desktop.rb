  caveats <<~CAVEATS
    Hyprlayer is not yet notarized by Apple, so on first launch macOS may block
    it with "Apple cannot check it for malicious software." To allow it:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Hyprlayer.app"

    or install without quarantine up front:

      brew install --cask --no-quarantine hyprlayer-desktop
